                I do agree that when it comes to cyber warfare, we have more to lose than any other nation on earth.
                NASSCOM reports that despite having the largest IT talent pool in the world, India simply lacks skilled
                cyber security professionals. In fact, the need for experienced professionals is so high that companies
                are willing to pay a premium salary of over Rs 1.5 to 4 crore to top talent.Hacking is exploiting
                security controls either in a technical, physical or a human-based element. Cyber experts have indicated
                placing critical infrastructure to predict and prevent cyber crimes were important.

                No matter how many developments we see in the wide use of AI, it is still not possible for AI to replace
                human intelligence. The core aspect of human intelligence remains our ability to consider ourselves and
                others, feel empathy, make decisions based not only on data but also instinct, and read the emotions of
                people around us in order to adjust our behavior, a key aspect of human interaction.
                But the fact that computers are not able to mimic this currently does not mean it will always be
                impossible. This remains one of the biggest debates concerning AI today.
                While some people are excited to see all that AI can achieve, others have warned about possible dangers
                and social impacts it could have. For now the future is not clear, but we should approach it with
                excitement and an open mind, trying to benefit from all AI has made possible, while continuing to value
                our own intelligence and emotions.

                C-DAC Mumbai, earlier known as NCST, started operations in the Juhu campus in 1985. There are two
                campuses in Mumbai, at Juhu and at Kharghar. It has a rich history of cutting edge R&D in areas of
                Computer Graphics, Computer Networks, Language Translation, Educational Applications of AI, Resource
                Scheduling, etc. It was among the pioneers in bringing Internet to India through the ERNET project, and
                also in multi-lingual technologies.

                If it is one fact that the entire world has understood in the last few years, it is the fact that we
                need to start making amends so that the environment that we have destroyed so much has some scope of
                recuperating. With almost all developed nations now paving the way towards a clean mobility revolution,
                India has also begun to make the needed changes.

                The launch of electric vehicles has set in motion a paradigm shift that will make people more
                responsible towards the environment and give them the perks of cleaner air and financial security by
                saving them from the shocks of those constant fluctuating prices of fuel.

                The spark that ignited this change was when electric motors replaced the traditional internal combustion
                engine (ICE). What started as a mere trend is soon to take over the markets entirely by the year 2030.
                The consumers' reactions were checked with the launch of the first electric car Reva, which Chetan Maini
                launched in 2001.

                If you thought 2021 wouldn't have surprising tech and gadgets, think again. The year's already had a
                great start with unconventional introductions in AI and VR, and we can't wait to explore more. So what's
                next in the future of tech and gadgets? Are you going to see flying cars soon or wear a pair of AR
                contact lenses? Keep reading the blog to check out all the new tech that's surprised us in 2021.
                What would it be like if you could work from home and be physically (virtually) present on a conference
                call? Or, perhaps, work on a laptop that spreads out its seven screens like wings! Thanks to the future
                of tech and gadgets in 2021, we can finally stop dreaming about these projects—because they’re starting
                to become real.
